Quicksort Algo in different languages

The Quicksort Algorithm is a recursive algorithm that sorts elements in an array (or similar data structure).

1. If the input is only one or two items, sort and return the items
2. Select Pivot Value
3. Separate items that are larger than the pivot from items that are smaller than the pivot
4. Recursively execute Quicksort with the lower and larger values and return the concatenated array
