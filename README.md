# QuickSortImplementations
Quicksort Algo in different languages

The Quicksort Algorithm is a recursive algorithm that sorts elements in an array (or similar data structure).

1. If the input is only one or two items, sort and return
2. Select Pivot Value
3. Separate items that are larger than the pivot from items that are smaller than the pivot
4. Recursively execute Quicksort with the lower and larger values

Note: The algorithm can be written to instantiate local arrays and return them to be concatenated at the highest level of execution fo the algorithm but it is more efficient to work within the array as opposed to instantiating local arrays
